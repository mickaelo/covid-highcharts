Quick app to fetch openData on covid, inject in ES database and display it through Highcharts library in the frontend.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start` in the MAIN folder

It will run the node server to get access to the different api calls

### `npm start` in the REACT folder

It will run the react app on the 3000 port
